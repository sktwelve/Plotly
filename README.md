## Overview:

This website is first populated by the first entry of the json file which is then pushed to the javascript file connected to the site. The javascript is used to create the charts using the json file entries. The code itself is called using D3, changing the charts when the option on the dropdown menu is changed. CSS is used to then customize the page to make the theme of the page blend together and be visually appealing.
